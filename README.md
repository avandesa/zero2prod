# Zero to Production

This is a code-along from [Luca Palmieri's][luca] [Zero to Production in Rust][zero2prod]. Most of the code is taken directly from the book, with a few adjustments and adaptations I felt were appropriate or which were prompted by the book.

It's a really good book, please go buy it: https://www.zero2prod.com/

The repository is public to track progress. There is currently no public deployment (do I look like I'm made of money?).
